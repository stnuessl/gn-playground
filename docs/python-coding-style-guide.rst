Python Coding Style Guide
=========================

The python ecosystem offers a wide variety of world-class tools. We therefore
don't have to rely on manually written coding guidelines and manual reviews
for those guidelines, but instead we'll enforce them by automated checks.

This document briefly summarizes the most important use-cases which any
software developer should be familiar with.

Linting Python Code
-------------------

To check python code for obvious coding issues, run the command below
in a terminal.

.. code-block:: sh

    uv run ruff check


Formatting Python Code
----------------------

To automatically format python code, run the command below in a terminal:

.. code-block:: sh

    uv run ruff format

Using Ninja for Checking Python Code
------------------------------------

Simply invoke the command below to check the linting and formatting of python
code:

.. code-block::

    ninja check-python
